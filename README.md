My naive attempted solution for the "Anagram" kata from codingdojo.org: https://codingdojo.org/kata/Anagram/

Source code is in [anagram.ts](src/anagram.ts), tests are in [anagram.spec.ts](src/anagram.spec.ts).

It looks to me like the code should work, but it cannot find any two-word anagrams for the word "documenting". I cannot tell whether my code that is wrong, if I have misunderstood the task, or if the supplied word list is pranking me. So, I'm sharing the code in hopes of finding an answer.

How to run this code:

- Have Node.js and npm installed
- Install dependencies with `npm i`
- Run the tests with `npm test`
